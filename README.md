This repository contains Python implementation of team formation algorithms that were introduced in the last decade.
We proposed two algorithms that rely on power law property of degree distribution of a social network. 
We named thsese algorithms as TPLRandom and TPLClosest algorithms.

For comparison, we also implemented MinLD*, MinSD and Rarestfirst algorithms.
Our focus is to classical algorithms.
